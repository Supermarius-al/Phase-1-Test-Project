Marius’ Phase 1 Project
•	The basic story of your application
•	The core features of your MVP
•	The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
•	Challenges you expect to face
•	How you are meeting the requirements of the project

•	Basic Story: Sometimes, those of us without much experience exercising in a gym can feel lost when they enter a gym.  I’d like to build a fitness page for users to get a work out plan (upper body and lower body workouts) then provide them with a a work out regime that meets their goal.  Users will be able to keep track and update the amounts they've been lifting.
•	Features:
o	Provide users a basic program to follow broken down by lower and upper body exercises
o	Allow users to keep track of amount lifted or distances run
•	API Data would be self written JSON
•	Challenges I expect are going to be on the API side as far as mastering it and updating it and how indepth the fitness portions will be
•	Meets the requirements because there would be a “Click”, “Submit” and “DOMContentLoaded” event listeners
