Marius’ Phase 1 Project
•	The basic story of your application
•	The core features of your MVP
•	The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
•	Challenges you expect to face
•	How you are meeting the requirements of the project

•	Basic Story:  I’d like to build a generic fitness page for users based on a selection of their goals (lose weight, gain weight, maintain weight) then provide them with a a work out regime that meets their goal
•	Features:
o	 Provide users a basic program based on their goal
o	Allow users to keep track of amount lifted or distances run
•	API Data would be self written JSON
•	Challenges I expect are going to be on the API side and how indepth the fitness portions will be
•	Meets the requirements because there would be a “Click”, “Submit” and “DOMContentLoaded” event listeners
